Product Perspective
The OR code is an abbreviation of "Quick Response Code" It is a type of square-shaped barcode which is readable by machines to unlock the information that is contained inside. it was invented in 1994 oy a Japanese company called Denso Wave, and has since been used across the world in many applications QR Codes do not require a heavyset machine scanner to scan them because they are quickly accessible through the camera of a mobile phone or any OR Code reader app It is possible to scan a QR Code by opening your smartphone camera feature or downloading a QR Code reader. Hold the smartphone steady for 2-4 seconds towards the QR Code you want to scan and click on the notification to access the content of the QR Code.

For cloning you should use cd to go to your folder, than git clone and paste your url link copied from github. After cloning the project you need to go to the project with cd and write code .

After VSC opens, go to your folder and npx create-react-app .

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
